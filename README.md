THIS IS MY FIRST REPO
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with a strong interest in programming, networking, and cybersecurity. This space serves as a portfolio of my learning journey, where I work on academic projects, explore new technologies, and continuously build my skills in Python, web development, and cloud computing. I am passionate about problem-solving and committed to developing practical, real-world applications. I look forward to collaborating, contributing to open-source, and growing within the developer community.
